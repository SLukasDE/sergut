## Short Description

This library is meant to make it simple to serialize C++ datastructures. It
supports de-/serialization of (simple) XML and serialization of JSON. However,
adding new formats should be more or less straight forward. Especially if those
formats can be converted into some kind of tree notation (something like DOM
for XML).

A detailed documentation for how to use sergut is maintained as Doxygen source
code comments. You can also have a look at test/sergut/TestSergut.cpp to get an
idea of the possibilities you have with this library.



## Dependencies & Compiling

One of the XML deserializers uses the TinyXML-2 library. You can download it
from https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2. In case you copy the headers and
the libs to a non-standard location you have to tell the build system by
creating a local.pri file in the base directory and setting the variables
CPP_TINYXML_LIB_PATH and CPP_TINYXML_INCLUDE_PATH.

The unittests require the `catch` unittesting framework. It can be downloaded
from https://github.com/philsquared/Catch. If you install it to a non-standard
location, you have to create a local.pri file and have the
CPP_CATCH_INCLUDE_PATH point to it. But you don't have to compile the
unittests.

sergut is compiled using qmake. Apart from that it does not require any Qt. To
build it you have to choose another directory, where you want the project to be
built into. `cd` into it and call `qmake -r <path-to-sergut>/sergut.pro` from
there. This will create the aktual Makefiles. The project can then be compiled
by calling `make`.
